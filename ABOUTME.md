My name is Slobodan Kovacevic (friends call me Bobo). I have been working as software developer for more than twenty years.

I have been developing softare since highschool, but professionaly after the colledge. I spend the most time building systems for manufacturing companies, called Manufacturing Execution System, to help them track their production, materials, quality, equipment etc. 

In last few years I heard a lot about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This year I spend a lot of time learning about different blockchains and I was amazed with their principless of open code and possibilities they provide. I deffinitely decided to become the part of blockchain community and to help building better web.
