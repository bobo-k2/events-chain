My name is Slobodan Kovacevic (friends call me Bobo). I have been working as software developer for more than twenty years.

I have been developing software since high school, but professionally after the college. I spend the most time building systems for manufacturing companies, called Manufacturing Execution System, to help them track their production, materials, quality, equipment etc. 

In last few years I heard a lot about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. This year I spend a lot of time learning about different blockchains and I was amazed with their openness and their possibilities and potential to build better applications. After everything I read and heard I decided to become the part of blockchain community and to help building better web.
